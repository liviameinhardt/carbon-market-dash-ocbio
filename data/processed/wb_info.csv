The carbon tax is a component of the energy tax (official name: Energiavero), which also includes components-based energy content and a contribution to maintaining the security of supply. The base of the carbon tax is the lifetime CO2 emissions of a product. The tax strengthens incentives created under the EU ETS, adding additional carbon costs to fuel-use emissions and capturing additional emissions not captured under the ETS. ;The carbon tax on transportation fuels was reduced from 77 €/tCO2 to 62 €/tCO2 from the start of 2024.;The Finland carbon tax applies to direct and indirect (lifecycle) CO2 emissions from energy products in motor fuel or heating use. The tax covers all fossil fuels except for peat.

It was introduced gradually as part of a larger environmental tax package, which includes energy taxes and a sulfur tax, as well as subsidies for green investments. The tax complements the EU ETS, covering much of the fuel-use not captured under the ETS. The tax rate for each fuel is calculated based on volume, weight or calorific value of fuel used, with rates for each fuel set to align with the nominated /tCO2-e price. The tax is recalculated annually to take inflation into account.   ;The government has reached agreement with several other parties to introduce a new CO2 tax on companies from 2025.

It is a cornerstone instrument of the EU’s policy framework to combat climate change under the “European Green Deal” and reduce GHG emissions cost-effectively. The EU ETS is currently in its fourth trading phase (2021 to 2030). Every year, covered entities must surrender allowances for their emissions under the EU ETS. Auctioning is the main method of distributing allowances, with free allocation, based on benchmarks, used to address carbon leakage. ;The EU has adopted a number of reforms to the EU ETS as part of the “Fit for 55” package to align the system with the EU’s 2030 climate target of at least 55% net emissions reductions compared to 1990 levels and the European Green Deal objectives. The reforms increased the ambition and expanded the scope of the EU ETS to maritime transport, and introduced a new, separate emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and additional sectors (called EU ETS 2). The reforms also established a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to address the risk of carbon leakage from specific sectors under the EU ETS (as an alternative to free allocation). ;"The EU ETS applies to direct (scope 1) emissions from activities in the power sector, manufacturing, industry, and intra-EU aviation (including flights from the EEA to the United Kingdom). The EU ETS covers CO2 emissions, and emissions of other gases from certain activities. Each sector or activity has a specific threshold for participation.

Recent reforms to the scheme expanded its scope to maritime transport, and introduced a new, separate emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and additional sectors (EU ETS 2) Emission-intensive and/or trade-intensive sectors have received a significant volume of free allowances to manage carbon leakage risks. Sectors-specific performance benchmarks are used to determine free allocations. The values are adjusted for technological progress on a yearly basis. An annual reduction rate is determined for each benchmark. For the steel sector, which faces high abatement costs and leakage risks, a fixed reduction rate applies. 

Free allocation for 2026 to 2030 will become conditional on the implementation of energy efficiency measures (based on audits or energy management systems) and of carbon neutrality plans for the worst performing installations, in order to incentivise decarbonisation. 

Free allocation to specific sectors will be gradually phased out from 2026 to 2034, in parallel to the phase-in of EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) for third-country imports. Those sectors are - iron and steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizers and hydrogen. The CBAM will also apply to electricity imports.";"From January 2019, the market stability reserve (MSR) started shaping the supply of allowances to provide greater price stability and predictability in the EU ETS. The MSR achieves this goal by removing allowances from the market if the number of total allowances in circulation is higher than 833 million allowances, and injecting allowances into the market if the number of allowances in circulation falls below 400 million. From 2019 until 2023, the yearly withholding rate of surplus allowances into the MSR is temporarily doubled to 24%. In addition, as of 2023 the number of allowances held in the MSR will be limited to the previous year's auction volume and any allowances beyond that number being invalidated.

As of Phase 4, a Member State may also cancel allowances from their share of allowances to be auctioned if they take additional measures that result in closure of electricity generation capacity. The quantity of allowances invalidated shall not exceed the average verified emissions of the installation from five years preceding the closure. Emission allowances under the cap are distributed via a combination of free allocation and auctioning. Industry and aviation sectors receive free allocation based on EU-wide benchmarks and historical activity data. The free allocation to industry sectors also depends on their emission and/or trade intensity and is corrected to ensure the total free allowances does not exceed the available allowances for free allocation. The power sector does not receive any free allocation. The total number of free allowances available for free allocation declines annually. The total amount of emission allowances is determined top-down and decreases annually. From 2021 onwards, the cap decreases annually by 2.2% instead of 1.74%.";Point source: Operators are liable for reporting the emissions covered under the EU ETS at a facility level and surrendering an equivalent amount of EU emission allowances.

It covers large emitting facilities, with the ability for lower emitting facilities to opt in to the regulation. 
 
Covered entities must reduce their emissions intensity (emissions per unit of production) by a set percentage each year. The reduction requirement is based on a facility’s average emissions intensity over a three-year historic period or compared to a sector-specific benchmark. Covered entities that outperform their targets generate emissions performance credits (EPCs), which can be sold or used in future compliance years. Those that exceed their limits are required to provide compensation by either (1) purchasing EPCs from other covered facilities, (2) paying into the TIER fund to purchase a fund credit for each tonne of excess emissions, or (3) purchasing emission offset credits generated within Alberta under an approved offset protocol or sequestration credits. ";"Alberta’s Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) Regulation was amended in December 2022, with changes taking effect on January 1, 2023. Updates included setting the carbon price in line with the federal benchmark; tightening output-based benchmarks by 2% annually from 2023 to 2030 and also increasing the tightening rates of the oil sands sectors by 4% in 2029 and 2030; reducing the opt-in threshold to 2,000 tonne  per year; increasing the limits on emission performance and offsets usage from 60% in 2023 by 10% annually until it reaches 90% in 2026; reducing the credit expiry to five years; establishing sequestration credits and capture recognition tonnes  to support carbon capture, utilization, and storage investments; and changing the biomass emissions treatment to support bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.
";"Alberta’s TIER Regulation applies to all greenhouse gas emissions from facilities that emit 100 ktCO2-e/year or more, including industry, power, food processing, waste and other sectors. Smaller conventional oil and gas facilities can aggregate and opt-in to the regulation. Lower emitting facilities (those emitting 2,000 tonnes CO2e or more per year) can opt-in to the regulation.

Alberta’s TIER system directly covers approximately 60% of Alberta’s emissions. The ETS extends the price signal to broader sectors. The output-based pricing system approach itself is designed to protect the competitiveness of emissions-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) sectors by the use of benchmarks that apply carbon pricing to only a portion of their emissions. The emissions trading allowances to comply with the TIER Regulation also further enable cost-effective compliance and emission reductions.  

If TIER Regulation compliance costs exceed 3% of sales or 10% of profit at a facility, the facility owner may be eligible to receive some regulatory relief under the province’s Compliance Cost Containment Program.";"Regulated facilities can pay into the TIER fund to meet their compliance obligations at a fixed price set at $65 per tonne in 2023, rising by $15 per tonne annually to $170 per tonne in 2030. This acts as a price ceiling for the scheme. 

To address facilities that are competitively impacted or at risk from being competitively impacted by the TIER Regulation, if  compliance costs exceed 3% of sales or 10% of profit at a facility, the facility owner may be eligible to receive some regulatory relief under the province’s Compliance Cost Containment Program. The Alberta TIER system uses an output-based allocation approach. The emissions baseline of each facility (freely allocated emission level) is determined by a combination of emissions intensity benchmarks and production activity data. Facilities can use facility-specific benchmarks (FSBs) or sector high-performance benchmarks (HPBs), except for the electricity, heat and hydrogen sectors which are required to use HPBs. 

In 2022, FSBs were based on 88% of a facility’s past performance using 2013 through 2015 as a reference period for most existing facilities, except for oil sands mines and upgraders which are based on approximately 18% New facilities are subject to a compliance obligation starting in the third, full year of operation. HPBs are generally based on the average performance of the top 10% of facilities in a sector or equal to the top performer in sectors of less than 10.  

From 2023 forward, all FSBs and HPBs will tighten at a rate of 2% per year. In 2029 and 2030 FSBs and HPBs for the oil sands sector will tighten at a rate of 4% per year.  There is no cap on emissions in the Alberta TIER.";"Point source. Regulated facilities report the emissions covered under the Alberta TIER Regulation at a facility level and for meeting their compliance obligations. Regulated facilities need to meet compliance obligations on an annual basis. Carbon offsets are included in the TIER regulatory system. 
 
Regulated facilities can use offset credits to meet compliance obligations. Offset credits used for TIER Regulation compliance must be created in Alberta using protocols approved by the Alberta government.

";Market stability reserve;Point Source;Not permitted;"The Switzerland Emissions Trading System is a mandatory cap-and-trade system. The total amount of emission allowances is determined top-down and decreases annually. The ETS started in 2008 with a five-year phase during which companies could voluntarily join as an alternative to facing the Switzerland carbon tax (CO2 levy on fossil fuels). Starting from 2013, the ETS became mandatory for large energy-intensive industries and medium-sized industries could voluntarily join. Participants in the ETS continue to be exempted from the CO2 levy. On January 1, 2020, the linking of the Swiss and EU ETS came into force.  Ratification of the agreement by the EU and Switzerland was announced on December 12, 2019 and followed legislative revisions required for the Swiss ETS to be compatible with the EU ETS and comply with the agreement. With the linking agreement now in effect, covered entities in the Switzerland ETS can use allowances from the EU ETS for compliance, and vice versa. However, the two systems run separate auctions. The revised ‘Ordinance on the Reduction of CO2 Emissions (CO2 Ordinance),’ was adopted in November 2020, which embedded the new legal base for the Swiss ETS into the partially revised “CO2 Act” – the core framework of Switzerland’s climate legislation – that entered into force in January 2021.
";"After a revision of the CO2 Act failed to pass a referendum in June 2021, the Swiss Parliament extended the current CO2 Act to 2024. This included the target to reduce emissions by 1.5% per year compared to 1990 levels. In November 2022, the Swiss Federal Council published a new proposal for a revision of the CO2 Act that covers the period from 2025 to 2030, including Switzerland’s 50% emission reduction target for 2030. The proposal includes provisions to align the Swiss ETS with the revised EU ETS.
 
In November 2023, the EU and Switzerland concluded the 2024 emission allowance transfer arrangements between their systems. From January 2024, daily transfers, with exceptions for specific dates, replaced the previous twice-weekly schedule. Details on the 2025 arrangements are anticipated by the end of 2024. ";The Switzerland ETS applies to GHG emissions (CO2, NO2, CH4, HFCs, NF3, SF6 and PFCs) from fuel use in the industry, power and aviation sectors and industrial process emissions. Emission-intensive and/or trade-intensive sectors at risk of carbon leakage receive free allowances up to 100% of the benchmark level. Also, small emitters are exempt from the Switzerland ETS.;"The authorities introduced a market stability mechanism in 2022 that reduces auction volumes if the number of allowances in circulation exceed a certain threshold. The following elements are decisive for the calculation of the threshold: the number of allowances in circulation; and the maximum amount of emissions allowances available in the previous year (cap). 
 
If the number of allowances in circulation exceeds the cap of the previous year by more than a half, the market stability mechanism reduces the auction volume of the current year by 50%. In this case, the unauctioned allowances lose their validity after the end of the compliance period. The mechanism is regularly reviewed against market dynamics and developments in the EU. The Swiss ETS is not subject to the EU ETS Market Stability Reserve.   Emission allowances under the cap are distributed via a combination of free allocation and auctioning. Industry sectors receive free allocation based on the same benchmarks as the EU ETS and historical activity data. The free allocation to industry sectors also depends on their emission and/or trade intensity and is corrected to ensure the total free allowances does not exceed the available allowances for free allocation. Allowances that are not allocated for free are auctioned. As of 2022, auction volumes are subject to a market stability mechanism.   The total amount of emission allowances is determined top-down and decreases annually.";Point source: Operators are liable for reporting the emissions covered under the Switzerland ETS at a facility level and surrendering an equivalent amount of Swiss emission allowances (and eligible offsets).  Operators need to meet their compliance obligations on an annual basis. Operators need to surrender allowances by April 30 for the covered GHGs emitted in the previous calendar year.  International offsets were allowed up to 2020, subject to certain criteria. Most categories of credits from CDM projects in least-developed countries were allowed. Credits from CDM and JI projects from other countries were eligible only if registered and implemented before the end of 2012. As of 2021, offsets cannot be used to meet compliance obligations.;"Switzerland's ETS has been linked with the EU ETS since January 2020. Prior to that, revisions were made to align with the EU ETS legislative framework.
 
Covered entities in the Swiss ETS can use allowances from the EU ETS for compliance, and vice versa. The two systems run separate auctions. Market participants from the EEA need an account in the Swiss Emissions Trading Register in order to participate. Allowance transfers between the EU and Swiss registries are generally executed bi-monthly on pre-announced dates. 


In 2024, allowance transfers between the EU and Swiss registries will be executed on a daily basis, with specific exceptions for certain dates. This arrangement follows an agreement reached in November 2023 by the Joint Committee overseeing the EU and Swiss linking agreement. The 2024 arrangements cover a 12-month period, with information on 2025 arrangements expected before the end of 2024.

";Cost Containment Reserve, Price Floor;Upstream, Point Source;Not permitted;"The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) was launched in 2008 and covers roughly half of the country's emissions. Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their reported emissions.  

The NZ ETS was originally designed to operate without a specific hard domestic cap as this accommodated carbon sequestration from forestry activities and a full link to the international Kyoto Protocol carbon markets, but in 2015 the allowance supply was restricted to NZUs. The NZ ETS was originally conceived as a nested system under the Kyoto Protocol, with full links to international carbon markets. However, as of June 1 2015, the NZ ETS became a domestic-only system. In 2024, the cap is 27.9 MtCO2e. 

Extensive legislative reforms of the NZ ETS were implemented in 2020.";"2023 saw the continued development of the NZ ETS. The supply of units to the NZ ETS was tightened, bringing the cap trajectory in line with New Zealand’s net-zero targets. Unit supply settings, as well as auction reserve price settings for 2024 to 2028, were updated in September in accordance with a court order made following a successful legal challenge against the original settings. The new settings tighten unit supply, while also doubling the 2024 auction reserve price floor to NZD 64 (USD 39) and the CCR trigger price to at least NZD 184 (USD 112).  

Four auctions were undertaken throughout the year, with a total of 15 million units for sale, as well as another 8 million units available from the CCR. However, none of the auctions cleared, meaning no allowances were sold at auction in 2023. In line with the NZ ETS auctioning regulations, any units that were unsold after the last auction of 2023 are not available for sale at any subsequent auction.  

Plans progress pricing agricultural emissions have been delayed until 2030. ";The NZ ETS applies to GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs and PFCs) from the industry, power, waste, transport and forestry sectors and includes industrial process emissions. The agriculture sector needs to report its emissions but has no allowance surrendering obligations. Emissions-intensive and trade-exposed sectors at risk of carbon leakage receive free allowances of between 60 - 90% of the benchmark level.;"COST CONTAINMENT RESERVE: If a predetermined trigger price is reached at auction, a specified number of allowances from the Cost Containment Reserve (CCR) is additionally released for sale.

PRICE FLOOR: With the start of auctioning, the government introduced a price floor operating through a reserve price or minimum accepted bid at auction.  Free allocation is provided, based on output and intensity-based benchmarks, for 26 eligible industrial activities. Industrial free allocation is being phased down. A minimum annual phase-down rate of 0.01 across all industrial activities applies from 2021 to 2030. That rate will increase to 0.02 for the years 2031 to 2040, and to 0.03 for 2041 to 2050.

Auctioning was introduced in 2021. The volume of NZUs made available for auctioning is set on an annual basis, five years in advance. 15 million units were made available at auction in 2023, but none were sold. Auctions follow a sealed-bid, single-round format. The clearing price is set at the lowest successful bid and NZUs are sold to all successful bidders at this price, providing it is not below the confidential reserve price. Otherwise, the auction fails and all allowances on offer are rolled forward to the next auction within the same calendar year or cancelled if it is the last auction of that year. These represent the New Zealand Units (NZUs) surrendered in that year. The NZ ETS was originally designed to operate without a specific hard domestic cap as this accommodated carbon sequestration from forestry activities and a full link to the international Kyoto Protocol carbon markets, but in 2015 the allowance supply was restricted to NZUs. The NZ ETS will have its own fixed cap in the future.";Upstream: The point of regulation of the NZ ETS is as far upstream as possible. Fossil fuel importers and suppliers are liable for reporting the GHG emissions associated with their energy product at a facility level and surrendering an equivalent amount of emission allowances. Covered industrial facilities are liable for their process emissions. Importers of synthetic GHGs face an annually fixed levy based on the allowance price. Operators need to meet their compliance obligations on an annual basis, except for those in the forestry sector, who have five-yearly compliance obligations. The use of offset credits is not allowed. Access to high-integrity international carbon markets may to be part of New Zealand’s strategy to meet its 2030 target ;"The NZ ETS is not linked with any other system.  

Until June 2015, the NZ ETS was indirectly linked to other systems (e.g., the EU ETS) via the international Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms. Since then, the NZ ETS has been an exclusively domestic system.

The tax complements the Switzerland ETS, covering emissions not captured under the ETS, and a separate compensation obligation on fossil transport fuels.
";"The CO2 levy automatically increased to CHF 120 per ton of CO2 on 1 January 2022, as emissions of fossil heating and process fuels in 2020 were beyond 67 percent of the sector’s emissions in 1990 (Art. 94d, CO2 ordinance). Voters rejected a proposed revised CO2e Act in a referendum in 2021. In response, the Swiss Parliament in December 2021 adopted a prolongation of the CO2 Act through a partial revision of the CO2 Act until 2024.  It guarantees a continuation of existing measures, including the CO2 levy at its current rate of CHF 120 per tons of CO2e.
";The tax applies to CO2 emissions from fossil thermal fuels when used to generate heat, light or electricity. Operators covered by the Switzerland ETS are exempt from the Swiss CO2 tax. In addition, emissions-intensive operators (not covered by Switzerland's ETS) with competitiveness risks can receive a tax refund if they commit to an emission reduction target. ;"The price is set by the Government The tax is applied broadly, with exemptions provided to entities covered by the Switzerland ETS, and rebates provided for fuel used for purposes other than heat, light or electricity.
 ";Upstream: Distributors and importers of the fossil fuels covered are liable for payment of the tax.

OBPS) for large industrial emitters, which will price emissions that exceed specific limits at the current carbon tax rate. The B.C. OBPS will replace the CleanBC Industrial Incentive Program and will ensure emissions reductions for industry continue while providing flexible options, such as earned units and carbon offsets, to meet compliance obligations. 
";"The B.C. carbon tax applies to the purchase or use of fuels such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, heating fuel, propane and coal, unless a specific exemption applies. The use of fuel includes all uses, even if the fuel isn't combusted. The carbon tax also applies to combustibles (specifically peat, tires, and asphalt shingles) when they are burned to produce heat or energy. Various exemptions to the carbon tax include exported fuels, fuel consumption by aviation, shipping and locomotives travelling outside British Columbia, and colored gasoline and colored diesel purchased by farmers. 

Commercial greenhouse growers can apply to reduce their carbon tax rate on eligible natural gas and propane by 80%. 

The BC climate action tax credit is a quarterly rebate that helps offset the impact of the carbon taxes paid by individuals and families.

It started operating with ten states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont). RGGI’s development was based on the “2005 RGGI Memorandum of Understanding” (MOU) and on the “2006 RGGI Model Rule”. Through statutes or regulations based on the Model Rule, each state then established individual CO2budget trading programs.
 
RGGI covers power sector emissions in participating states. In 2020, it covered around 14% of the aggregate participant states’ emissions; in 2021, 228 facilities were covered by the state regulations. The aggregate cap will decrease by 30% compared to 2020 between 2021 and 2030. Under the ETS, covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Covered entities obtain most of their allowances through regular auctions, while some states have “set-aside” accounts from which they may transfer a limited number of allowances to entities’ compliance accounts.  ";"New Jersey withdrew from RGGI at the end of the first phase, or “control period” in December 2011 and later rejoined in 2020, while Virginia joined in 2021 and has announced its intent to leave in 2024.  

RGGI has undergone two review processes that updated the Model Rule and enshrined tighter caps and adjustments to system design. RGGI’s third review process is currently ongoing.  ";RGGI covers CO2 emissions from fossil fuel electric generating units (i.e., fossil fuel-fired stationary boilers, combustion turbines, or combined cycle systems). RGGI covers CO2 emissions only.  Small power plants are exempt from RGGI.;"An auction price floor is set at US$ 2.38 per short ton in 2021, increasing by 2.5% per year to reflect inflation. In addition, there is a Cost Containment Reserve (CCR) as a staged price relief mechanism. The CCR creates a fixed additional supply of allowances that are only available for sale if CO2 allowance prices exceed certain price levels (US$10/tCO2 in 2017, rising by 2.5% annually between 2018 and 2020). 

In 2021, under the new model rule, the CCR trigger price is set at US$13 and will increase by 7% annually compared to the previous year. In addition, the new model rule established an Emissions Containment Reserve (ECR) in 2021: allowances are withheld from auction if the price is below the trigger price. In 2021, this trigger price will be set at US$6. The trigger prices of the CCR and ECR are set to increase annually by 7% compared to the previous year. The majority of emission allowances are allocated through quarterly auctions using a ""single-round, sealed-bid uniform-price"" format. Auctions are open to all parties with financial security, with a maximum bid of 25% of auctioned allowances per quarterly auction.  The total amount of emission allowances is determined top-down and decreases annually. The total amount is further reduced by the amount of allowances banked by operators the in the previous control periods.";Operators are liable for reporting the emissions covered under RGGI at a facility level and surrendering an equivalent amount of emission allowances (and eligible offsets).  The compliance cycle is based on three-year control periods, with quarterly (i.e. every three months) emissions reporting requirements and yearly interim control periods. Each facility must hold allowances equal to 50% of its emissions in each of the first two years of a control period. Each facility must hold allowances equal to 100% of its remaining emissions for the entire three-year control period at the end of the three-year control period.  Power plants participating in RGGI are allowed to use offsets to meet up to 3.3% of their compliance obligations.

Launched in April 2010, the Tokyo CaT is Japan's first mandatory carbon market and is linked to the Saitama ETS. The Tokyo CaT introduced mandatory emission reduction targets for large emitters.

Each covered facility has its own cap, which serves as the “baseline” from which it must achieve its reduction target. Facilities’ baselines are calculated using base-year emissions and a compliance factor. Compliance factors are determined based on the type of facility and factors such as expected energy efficiency gains and the extent to which they consume energy supplied by other facilities.
";;The Tokyo CaT applies to energy-use related CO2 emissions from the industry, power and buildings sectors. Operators do not have to pay for GHG emission up to their baseline emission level. Only if the baseline emission level are exceeded, operators must surrender a number of credits. Also, small energy users and residential buildings are exempt from the Tokyo CaT.;"In general, covered facilities trade over the counter and authorities do not control carbon prices. However, of prices evolve to levels deemed excessive, the authorities can introduce offset credits to be used for compliance in the Tokyo CaT.  All allowances in the Tokyo Cap-and-Trade Program are allocated for free. Under the Tokyo ETS, each facility has its own cap, which serves as the “baseline” from which it must achieve its reduction target.

The absolute emission baseline of each facility is determined by the historical emissions associated with their total energy consumption and emission reduction target. This includes indirect emissions from heat and electricity consumption. Operators can earn Excess Emission Reduction credits if their emissions are below their baseline level, and sell these credits to other covered operators or bank them for future compliance. Emission units shown here are the estimated Excess Emission Reduction credits generated in that year. The total emission limit under the Tokyo CaT is the bottom-up combination of the absolute emission baseline for each covered facility.";"Downstream (industry, buildings).

Operators need to meet their compliance obligations for the emissions above the baseline emission level through surrendering an equivalent amount of Excess Emission Reduction credits, credits from the Saitama ETS or offsets (See Use of offsets).
 The compliance cycle is based on a five-year compliance period. Operators have to submit their emissions reports on an annual basis and meet their compliance obligation at the end of the five-year compliance period (second compliance period is 1 April 2015 to 30 September 2021).

These taxes were introduced on a phased basis in Ireland starting with MOTCC on auto-fuels in December 2009. This was followed in May 2010 by MOTCC on other liquid fuels and NGCT on natural gas was officially implemented from May 1, 2010. Ireland’s carbon tax regime was extended to solid fuels in May 2013 when SFCT was introduced. The Finance Act 2020 legislated for annual increases in carbon tax to EUR100/tCO2 by 2030. A series of annual increases of EUR7.50 apply to the amount charged per tCO2 emitted coming into effect from 2021 and for each year thereafter up to and including 2029 with a final increase of EUR6.50 in 2030. The tax complements the EU ETS, covering emissions from fuel combustion not covered by the ETS.;From 1 May 2023 rates of MOTCC on non-propellant fuels increased on the basis of charging €48.50 per tonne of CO2 emissions. NGCT and SFCT rates also increased on that date based on charging €48.50 per tonne of CO2 emissions. The basis of MOTCC rates on petrol, auto-diesel, aviation gasoline, heavy oils used for air navigation and private pleasure navigation, and substitute fuels used as a propellant increased from €48.50 to €56 per tonne of CO2 emissions on 10 October 2023.;The Ireland carbon tax applies to direct (scope 1) CO2 emissions from all fossil fuels mostly in the residential, commercial and road transport sectors. Fuels used for electricity production, some industrial processes (chemical reduction, electrolytic and  metallurgical processes), commercial sea-fishing, shipping, and jet fuel used in commercial aviation sectors are exempt from the carbon taxation. Fuels used in in installations covered by a Green House Gas (GHG) permit, issued in accordance with the EU ETS, are also relieved from carbon taxation. A full relief from carbon taxation applies to liquid fuels (MOTCC) and to peat (SFCT) used in such installations. A partial relief applies to natural gas (NGCT) and to coal (SFCT) when used in installations covered by a GHG permit. ;The price is set by the Government and increases each year based on a pre-determined trajectory up to 2030  ;"Upstream: Distributors and importers of the fossil fuels covered are liable for payment of the tax. MOT - Real-time: the tax is paid when fuels are delivered, but in some cases entities may make periodic payments, based on an aggregate liability due over up to a week, or pay only on the 15th of each month in line with monthly reporting requirements.

The cap is aggregated bottom-up from annual facility-level emissions limits (‘baselines’). Covered entities must surrender allowances for emissions that exceed the facility-specific baseline, which is based on absolute historical emissions. The baselines are calculated using base-year emissions and a compliance factor, which is set for each period based on regulations established by the Governor of Saitama and expert consultation. Saitama’s ETS is linked to Tokyo’s cap-and-trade program, with credits mutually exchangeable between the two jurisdictions.
";;The Saitama ETS applies to energy-use-related CO2 emissions from the industry, power and buildings sectors. It covers about 600 entities in the industrial and commercial buildings sectors. Operators do not have to pay for GHG emission up to their baseline emission level. Only if the baseline emission level are exceeded, operators must surrender a number of credits. Also, small energy users and residential buildings are exempt from the Saitama ETS.; The absolute emission baseline of each facility is determined by the historical emissions associated with their total energy consumption and emission reduction target. This includes indirect emissions from heat and electricity consumption. Operators can earn Excess Emission Reduction credits if their emissions are below their baseline level, and sell these credits to other covered operators or bank them for future compliance. Emission units shown here are the estimated Excess Emission Reduction credits generated in that year. The total emission limit under the Saitama ETS is the bottom-up combination of the absolute emission baseline for each covered facility.;"Operators are liable for reporting the emissions related to their total energy consumption at a facility level, including indirect emissions from heat and power consumption. Operators need to meet their compliance obligations for the emissions above the baseline emission level through surrendering an equivalent amount of Excess Emission Reduction credits, credits from the Tokyo CaT or offsets (See Use of offsets). The compliance cycle is based on a five-year compliance period. Operators have to submit their emissions reports on an annual basis and meet their compliance obligation at the end of the five-year compliance period.
 Operators can use eligible offsets to meet their compliance obligations. Eligible offsets include credits generated from energy efficiency measures in small and midsize facility generated in Saitama, renewable energy projects, Tokyo Credits issued by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, forestry absorption projects, and emission reduction measures in large facilities outside Saitama.";The Saitama ETS is linked to the Tokyo CaT and operators can use credits from the Tokyo CaT to meet their compliance. ;Industry, Mining and extractives, Buildings;2011;;East Asia & Pacific;High income;Subnacional - Município;35,9754168;139,4160114

";;"The scheme applies to GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs, PFCs, NF3, and other fluorinated GHGs) from the industry, power, transport and buildings sectors and includes industrial process emissions.

Facilities emitting ≥25,000 tCO2e per year are covered. All electricity imported from specified sources connected to a specific generator with emissions >25,000 tCO2e per year is covered. 

The program covers ~75% of the state’s GHG emissions, and around 400 facilities.  Emission-intensive and trade-intensive sectors at risk of carbon leakage can receive industry assistance as free allowances up to 100% of the benchmark level. Leakage risk is divided into “low”, “medium”, and “high” risk tiers based on levels of emissions intensity and trade exposure for each specific industrial sector. ";"An auction reserve price (i.e. the minimum price that allowances can be sold for at an auction) was set at USD 24.04 per allowance in 2024. The auction reserve price increases annually by 5% plus inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.

Some allowances from each annual cap are placed in an Allowance Price Containment Reserve (APCR).

The scheme includes a price ceiling. Covered entities can purchase allowances at the price ceiling, (or, if no allowances remain, “price ceiling units”) up to the amount of its current unfulfilled emissions obligation. The revenues from the sale of price ceiling units will be used to purchase real, permanent, quantifiable, verifiable, enforceable, and additional emissions reductions on at least a tonne for tonne basis. Sales at the price ceiling will only be conducted if no allowances remain at the two lower Allowance Price Containment Reserve (APCR) tiers and a covered entity has demonstrated that it does not have sufficient compliance instruments in its accounts for that year’s compliance eve.
  
In 2024, the two APCR tiers and the price ceiling are set at USD 56.20, USD 72.21, and USD 88.20, respectively. Tier prices and the price ceiling increase by 5% plus inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).  Emission allowances under the cap are distributed via a combination of free allocation and auctioning. Industrial facilities receive free allowances for transition assistance and to prevent carbon leakage. Free allowances are allocated according to specific benchmarks, actual production volumes, a general cap adjustment factor and an industry assistance factor based on an assessment of carbon leakage risk. Electricity distributors and natural gas suppliers receive consigned allowances on behalf of their ratepayers that they have to auction. These auction revenues have to be used to benefit ratepayers and for emissions reduction measures. Other facilities do not receive free allowances. The total amount of emission allowances is determined top-down and decreases annually.";Industry operators (> 25,000 tCO2e) are liable for reporting their covered emissions at a facility level. In the power sector, the entity liable is the first deliverer of electricity: the electricity generator or importer. For transport and buildings sector, the supplier of transport fuels and natural gas is liable. All liable entities need to surrender an equivalent amount of emission allowances (and eligible offsets).  The compliance cycle is based on a three-year compliance period. Operators have to submit their emissions reports on an annual basis. For the first two year of the compliance period, operators have an annual partial compliance obligation equivalent to 30% each year's emissions. For the last of the compliance period, operators need to meet their compliance obligations by November 1 in the year after the compliance period ends. Until 2020, operators can use eligible offsets to meet up to 8% of their compliance obligations. From 2021 until 2025, this will be reduced to 4% and from 2026 until 2030 this will be limited to 6%.

The system covers fuel combustion emissions in the power, buildings, transport, and industrial sectors, as well as industrial process emissions. Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Most emission units are auctioned, with a portion freely allocated to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) sectors and to electricity producers with fixed-price sales contracts concluded before the announcement of the system.

";;"The Quebec CaT applies to GHG emissions from the industry, power, transport and buildings sectors and includes industrial process emissions. Québec keeps an emission units reserve account to sell to entities that do not have enough allowances to cover their obligations. Covered entities can also cover a part of their GHG emissions by using offset credits. 
";"The auction reserve price sets the minimum price at which emission units are available at auction. It is equivalent to the annual minimum price of the previous year, increased by 5% and an Indexation rate based on the Price Index Consumption (CPI) as established by the “Financial Administration Act”. For 2024, it is set at CAD 22.93 (USD 16.98) for Québec and USD 24.04 for California. For joint auctions with California, the highest value in USD between Québec’s and California’s auction reserve prices, based on the exchange rate of the Bank of Canada the day prior to the auction, will be the reserve price for that sale.

Québec maintains an emission unit reserve to sell to entities that do not have enough allowances to cover their obligations (“sales by mutual agreement”). The reserve is filled with set portions of the annual cap (4% for 2021 and beyond).  Sales by mutual agreement are held a maximum of four times per year at three price categories that contain an equal share of emission units on offer.

December 2020, Québec amended the prices of its three tiers to align more closely with California. For 2024, the prices of the three tiers are CAD 54.67 (USD 40.50), CAD 70.24 (USD 52.15), and CAD 85.83 (USD 63.58).  Emission allowances under the cap are distributed via a combination of free allocation and auctioning.

Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Since its launch, its scope has expanded to include ceramics, textiles, and data centres. The ETS has an absolute cap that is announced annually.;;"The Guangdong pilot ETS applies to CO2 emissions from the industry and domestic aviation sectors. Allowances are distributed primarily via free allocation through grandparenting based on historical emissions or emissions intensity, or benchmarking. Benchmarking is applied to industrial processes in the aviation, cement, paper, steel sectors, and data centres. Grandparenting on the basis of total historical emissions is applied to some processes in the cement and steel industries, the whole petrochemicals industry and textile industry. Grandparenting on the basis of historical emissions intensity is also applied to some products in the cement industry, power plants in the steel industry, special paper and paper product manufacturers, enterprises with pulp manufacturing, other aviation enterprises, ceramic industry (building and hygiene) and ports.  
";"5% of allowances are set aside for government reserves for new entrants and market stability. 

Auctions under the Guangdong Pilot ETS are subject to an auction reserve price. In 2015, a “policy reserve price” was set as an effective reserve price, which links the auction reserve price with the secondary market price. In 2016, the policy reserve price was set at 100% of the weighted average price for allowances over the previous three months. When auctions resumed in April 2020 for the compliance year 2019, the policy reserve price was set at 90% of the weighted average price for allowances over the previous three months, considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. No auctions were held in 2021, 2022 and 2023. 
Emission allowances under the cap are distributed via a combination of free allocation and auctioning, with auctioning making up a small component of the allocation framework. The power sector, certain types of airlines, and certain types of processes in the paper, cement and iron and steel sectors receive free allocation based on benchmarks, actual production data and a reduction factor.

The B.C. OBPS follows the Canadian federal carbon price path and ensures a price incentive for industrial emitters to reduce GHG emissions through a performance-based system. Facilities that emit under their annual emission limit earn credits. For facilities that emit over their emission limit, the B.C. OBPS provides flexible compliance options to meet compliance obligations. Flexible payment options include using earned credits, B.C. offsets, or making a direct payment. Banking is allowed. Borrowing is not allowed. 
";"IIn 2023, British Columbia announced the transition to an OBPS for large industrial emitters with its official implementation starting in April 2024. 

As part of “Budget 2023”, British Columbia announced the increase of B.C.’s carbon price to CAD 65 (USD 48.15) per tCO₂e for 2023, increasing by CAD 15 (USD 11.11) each year until it reaches CAD 170 (USD 125.93) in 2030; with this increase the province’s carbon price now meets the Government of Canada’s carbon price path. 

";"Participation is mandatory for producers of certain regulated industrial products under the “Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act” (GGIRCA) emitting ≥10,000 tCO2e/year. Industrial operations within regulated sectors under this threshold with annual emissions of ≥10,000 tCO2e/year are permitted to opt-in to the B.C. OBPS on a voluntary basis; those that do not opt-in remain subject to the B.C. Carbon Tax. 

The BC OBPS covers energy utilities, electricity import operations, greenhouses, waste management, and remediation services To compensate for emissions exceeding the facility’s annual emissions limit, a facility can use direct payments (compliance charge) to meet the facility’s compliance obligations at the full carbon price for that year. This price acts as a price ceiling and is aligned with the federal benchmark carbon price (CAD 80 [USD 59.26] in 2024). The price increases by CAD 15 (USD 11.11) each year until 2030, resulting in a price of CAD 170 (USD 125.93) per tCO2e in 2030.";"To compensate for emissions exceeding the facility’s annual emissions limit, a facility can use direct payments (compliance charge) to meet the facility’s compliance obligations at the full carbon price for that year.

Industrial facility’s emissions are assessed against a facility-specific emission limit, which is based on a product-specific performance standard. Facilities that emit less than their emissions limit receive credits (compliance units), free of charge from the government of British Columbia, corresponding to the number of tonnes CO2e below the limit. These earned credits can be banked or sold to entities that emit more than their emissions limits (see below for more details). Earned credits do not have an expiry date.

Tightening rates ensure a yearly gradual increase to the OBPS’s stringency. The B.C. OBPS tightening rate is set at 1% on all emissions for all products except for industrial process emissions; the tightening rate for industrial process emissions is set at 0% for all sectors. The total emission limit under the BC GGIRCA is the bottom-up combination of the emission intensity baseline for each covered facility.";"Point source.

 Operators need to meet their compliance obligations on an annual basis. Operators can use eligible offsets to meet their compliance obligations. Only offsets from projects that are approved, validated, and verified through the B.C. Carbon Registry are allowed as compliance option. Under the B.C. OBPS, offset units are limited to those generated within three years of the beginning of the compliance year.";"BC also imposes a carbon tax. Under the B.C.

Facility-level baselines are calculated using output-based benchmarking based on emissions intensity.  
 
Facilities emitting above their baseline must offset excess emissions by surrendering Safeguard Mechanism Credits (SMCs) or Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs). In some cases, facilities can also apply to average their emissions over a longer period or borrow from a future year.  
 
The Safeguard Mechanism was introduced in 2016 but had not been classified as a baseline-and-credit system as no tradeable permits were issued. However, as of July 2023, the government issues SMCs to facilities that over-achieve on their baseline. This reform was accompanied by a tightening of baselines and a default decline rate of 4.9% per year, to align the outcome with Australia’s 2030 targets.
";"Legislation to reform the Safeguard Mechanism was passed in March 2023, with changes entering into force from July 2023. The Safeguard Mechanism now assigns emissions baselines to over 200 large facilities, with those emitting above their baseline required to offset excess emissions. The reforms tightened emissions baselines for covered facilities and now allow the issuance of credits to facilities that overachieve on their baseline. This in effect turned the Safeguard Mechanism into a baseline-and-credit system. 
";The Safeguard Mechanism covers all direct (scope 1) GHG emissions from facilities emitting over 100kt CO2-e/year in electricity, mining, oil and gas production, manufacturing, transport and waste. Grid-connected electricity facilities are covered by one combined ‘sectoral’ baseline and it is not expected that the sectoral baseline will ever be breached.

This acts as a price cap. The price of these ACCUs is set at AUD 75 (USD 49.6) in the 2023 to 2024 financial year and will be indexed in future financial years by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus an additional 2% per year. This measure is intended to provide certainty to Safeguard facilities about the maximum compliance costs they will face under the reformed scheme.   Under the reformed Safeguard Mechanism, baselines are set based on production levels multiplied by an emissions intensity value. This value is initially set based on a facility’s current emissions intensity. However, over the seven years to 2030, baselines will transition to being set based on an industry average emissions intensity value. A sectoral baseline applies to grid-connected electricity generation, based on historical emissions. For facilities with no other baseline determined, a default of 100,000 tCO2e is applied. 

Facilities that overachieve on their baseline (with the exception of landfills and facilities accessing borrowing arrangements) are issued SMCs that can be banked for future use or sold to other facilities. 
 
Facilities that are considered at risk of carbon leakage (“trade-exposed baseline-adjusted”, or TEBA facilities) can apply for reduced baseline decline rates

The program covers around 150 entities in the energy, industrial, buildings, and transport sectors. Many of the cap-and-invest program’s design elements are similar to those of California’s cap-and-trade program.  Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Allowances are distributed through auctioning and free allocation, with the latter based primarily on benchmarking. 
 
The cap-and-invest program was established by the “Climate Commitment Act” (CCA), signed into law by Governor Jay Inslee in May 2021. ";"2023 marked the first full year of operation of the cap-and-invest program. Settlement prices at the May and August auctions were above the lower price threshold of the Allowance Price Containment Reserve, set at USD 51.90. This triggered two further sales from the reserve, held in August and November.  
 
In March 2023, the first two registries were approved as offset credit suppliers for the program: the American Carbon Registry and Climate Action Reserve. 
";The Washington CAR applies to GHG emissions from the industry, power, transport, waste and buildings sectors, and include industrial process emissions.

The auction reserve price increases by 5% plus inflation. 
 
The Allowance Price Containment Reserve (APCR) is a separate account managed by the Department of Ecology, from which allowances can be auctioned at pre-defined prices in the event of unexpectedly high allowance costs. 
 
If there are no units remaining in the APCR, price ceiling units are made available to covered entities with insufficient allowances to meet their compliance obligations. 
 
In addition, up to 10% of allowances can be withheld from an auction and placed in an Emissions Containment Reserve (ECR) if auction settlement prices fall below the ECR trigger price. The trigger price is currently suspended, and this provision is therefore not operational.  Entities that emit more than 25,000 tCO2e/year must acquire allowances for their emissions to meet a cap that decreases proportionally to Washington’s GHG limits. The Washington Department of Ecology is the administrative authority for the program and will adopt annual allowance budgets to be distributed through a combination of auctions (held as often as quarterly) and free allocation. The cap for 2023 was set at 63 MtCO2e, which is equal to 93% of average emissions levels of covered entities between the years 2015-2019. The cap declines annually by 7%, to reach 49 MtCO2e in 2026.

The approach requires all Canadian provinces and territories to have a carbon pricing system in place that aligns with the federal standard. A federal carbon pricing backstop system comes into effect, in whole or in part in any province or territory that requested it or that does not have a price on carbon in place that meets the federal standard. The federal backstop system consists of two components: a regulatory charge on fuels, and a baseline-and-credit ETS for emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industrial facilities called the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS).

To comply with the national system, provinces need to implement systems that meet the minimum national carbon price. The minimum national carbon price was set at CAD 65 (USD 48.15) in 2023, increasing by CAD 15 (USD 11.11) each year to reach CAD 170 (USD 125.93) in 2030.  As cap-and-trade systems set maximum emissions levels rather than minimum carbon prices, for these systems the minimum carbon pollution price is translated into an equivalent cap on emissions.";"All Canadian provinces and territories had until September 2022 to either request the federal carbon pollution pricing system or propose their own plan for a carbon pricing system for 2023 to 2030 that meets the updated benchmark criteria.  As of the beginning of 2024, the federal OBPS applies in Manitoba, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Yukon.  
 
The federal government amended its federal “backstop” OBPS in November 2023 to increase the stringency of the output-based standards used to determine facilities’ emissions limits. The rates are now set to decline at a fixed tightening rate with no end date: 2% annual tightening rate for most industrial facilities’ output-based standards and 1% for high-risk EITE facilities. Twelve new output-based standards for industrial activities have also been added to the regulations. ";"Coverage is mandatory for facilities in the EITE industrial and electricity sectors that emit equal to or more than 50,000 tCO2e per year. Smaller facilities with annual emissions equal to or more than 10,000 tCO₂e from sectors at risk of carbon leakage and adverse competitiveness impacts can opt in to participate voluntarily. The federal OBPS is designed to maintain the carbon price signal for industrial emitters to reduce their GHG emissions while mitigating the risk of carbon leakage and competitiveness impacts. It applies to facilities in the emissions-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) industrial and electricity sectors that emit equal to or more than 50,000 tCO2e. Smaller facilities with annual emissions equal to or more than 10,000 tCO₂e from sectors at risk of carbon leakage and adverse competitiveness impacts can apply to participate voluntarily. 
";"The excess emissions charge compliance option acts as a price ceiling for the system.  The excess emissions charge payment (ie, the minimum national carbon price set out in the federal benchmark) is set at CAD 80 (USD 59.26) in 2024, and will increase by CAD 15 (USD 11.11) annually until it reaches CAD 170 (USD 125.93) per tCO2e in 2030.  The OBPS sets a performance (output-based) standard (i.e., GHG emissions per unit of output) based on the national production-weighted average emissions intensity for a given activity in covered sectors. Facilities calculate a limit based on their level of production and the appropriate standard(s) and are required to provide compensation for emissions that exceed this limit. Those performing better than the standard are issued surplus credits (compliance units) that they can sell or save to use later. Facilities can comply by: (1) remitting surplus credits purchased from other facilities or retained from previous periods; (2) paying the carbon price; or (3) remitting eligible offset credits.  
 There is no hard cap on emissions under the federal system. The federal OBPS sets emissions-intensity or output-based standards by sector. ";"Point source. Operators are required to report their annual emissions and production at a facility level in a compliance report.   Facilities need to meet their compliance obligations on an annual basis. The use of offset credits is allowed. Two types of offset credits can be used for compliance under the OBPS: recognized units, and federal GHG offset credits. Both types of credits must have been issued for projects taking place in Canada that began in 2017 or later. Recognized units are offset credits issued by a province or territory under a recognized offset program and offset protocol and meet the requirements under section 78 of the OBPS including: have been issued for projects located in Canada and that began in 2017 or later. Since 2022, at least 25% of the compliance obligation must be met in the form of excess emissions charge payment. In the 2019 and 2020 compliance periods, no recognized units or federal GHG offset credits were remitted for compliance

The carbon tax applies to all facilities with annual direct GHG emissions of 25 ktCO2e or more, with no exemptions. The carbon tax rate is currently set at SGD25 tCO2e for 2024 and 2025, and the carbon tax revenue supports initiatives to address climate change. In addition, as announced at Budget 2022, companies have been able to surrender high quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions starting from 1 Jan 2024.  
";"The Government announced the outcomes of the carbon tax review during the national Budget held on 18 February 2022. There have been three main changes since 1 Jan 2024.  
 
First, the carbon tax rate was increased on 1 Jan 2024 to SGD25/tCO2e for 2024 and 2025, and will increase to SGD45/tCO2e in 2026 and 2027, with a view to reaching SGD50-80/tCO2e by 2030.  
 
Second, carbon tax coverage was expanded to include nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) emissions. 
  
Fourth, a transition framework has been introduced in 2024 to give existing emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) companies more time to adjust to a low-carbon economy. To help maintain business competitiveness in the near term and mitigate the risk of carbon leakage, existing facilities in EITE sectors receive transitory allowances for part of their emissions, based on efficiency standards and decarbonization targets";The Singapore carbon tax applies to direct emissions from facilities emitting 25 ktCO2e or more in a year, covering carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulphur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). The carbon tax is applied on all sectors without exemption as long as the facility meets the emissions threshold. Excise duties are also levied on transport fuels which serves as a carbon price signal for transportation emissions.   There are no exemptions to the carbon tax.   However, Singapore has introduced a transition framework since Jan 2024 to provide existing facilities in emissions-intensive trade exposed (EITE) sectors with transitory allowances for part of their emissions, based on efficiency standards and decarbonisation targets. Companies can continue to use existing support measures for decarbonisation, such as the Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy (REG(E)), Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F) and Genco EE Grant. ;The Government has set a pre-defined price trajectory. The carbon tax rate will be increased to SGD25/tCO2e in 2024 and 2025, and SGD45/tCO2e in 2026 and 2027, with a view to reaching SGD50-80/tCO2e by 2030.   ;"Point source (e.g. power stations and other large direct emitters)

Operators are liable for reporting the emissions covered by the Singapore carbon tax at a facility level.  The carbon tax is to be paid on an annual basis. The scheme allows companies subject to the carbon tax to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions from 1 Jan 2024, and cushion the impact for companies that are able to source credible carbon credits in a cost-effective manner.

It regulates more than 2,000 companies from the power sector with annual emissions of more than 26,000 tCO2, including combined heat and power, as well as captive power plants in other sectors. Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions, and allocation is based on intensity, with allowances freely allocated using benchmarks and based on actual production levels. Compliance obligations are currently limited and vary between different types of power generation. The system’s coverage will expand to other sectors over time. 
 
The national ETS builds on the experience of pilot carbon markets implemented in eight regions. These pilots continue to operate in parallel with the national ETS, covering sectors and entities not included in the national system. As the national system expands, entities covered by regional systems are expected to be integrated into it.
";"In January 2024, China launched its domestic offsetting scheme, the Chinese Certified Emissions Reduction scheme (CCER), after six years of suspension during which time it was undergoing reform. In October 2023, the MEE published the new regulations for the CCER, followed by four new methodologies including forestation, mangrove cultivation, solar thermal power, and grid-connected offshore wind power projects. In November 2023, the National Center for Climate Change Strategy Research and International Cooperation published guidelines for the CCER registry. The Beijing Green Exchange has also published guidelines for CCER trading and clearing. 
 
In February 2024, the State Council of the People’s Republic of China published a regulation for the national ETS, which significantly increased the punishment for non-compliance, data fraud and market manipulation behaviours.  ";The ETS  initially only applies to CO2 emissions from the power sector, including combined heat and power and captive power plants from other sectors.  ;"In May 2021, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) announced the option of establishing a market-regulating and protection mechanism. This would enable MEE to respond to abnormal fluctuations in trading prices, for instance through buy-back, auctioning or adjusting the rules related to CCER use. The necessary triggers and specifics of this mechanism are yet to be defined. Allowances are distributed for free, using benchmarking. 
Output-based benchmarking is used as the main allocation method, with four distinct benchmarks: conventional coal plants below 300 MW; conventional coal plants above 300 MW; unconventional coal; and natural gas.  

Entities received allowances at 70% of their 2021 verified emissions. Allocation was subsequently adjusted to reflect actual generation in 2021 and 2022. A unit load (output) adjustment factor distributed more allowances for entities operating at load rates lower than 85%. This may have provided more allowances to less efficient power units.

The cap under the China national ETS is the sum of the bottom-up total allowance allocation to all individual covered entities. The cap changes according to the actual production levels.  
 
The national ETS is estimated to have had a cap of ~4,500 MtCO2 in 2019 and 2020; and ~5,000 MtCO2 in 2021 and 2022.

Under the Mexico ETS, participating entities must surrender allowances for all of their covered emissions. Allowances are allocated through grandparenting based on historical emissions, which are verified annually.

The Mexican ETS started with a Pilot Program with two phases: a pilot phase between 2020 and 2021, and a transition phase in 2022.";"In 2023, the fourth allocation took place. 84% of participants complied with their surrender obligations in 2023.  

The country is expected to implement its domestic crediting mechanism for certified emissions mitigation, reduction, removals, capture or absorptions from national mitigation projects. Eligibility rules for the use of offset credits within the ETS are being developed based on a mapping of activities and projects that could be used for this purpose.  ";"Installations in the power and industry sectors with annual direct emissions from stationary sources of at least 100,000 tCO2. 
 While the Pilot Program is designed to pose no economic impact on regulated entities; however, noncompliant entities lose the opportunity to bank unused allowances into subsequent compliance periods within the pilot and will receive fewer allowances in the first allocation of the operational phase of the ETS (two fewer allowances for each nondelivered allowance during the pilot). 
 
Sanctions are expected to be implemented in the operational phase of the ETS. ";" Free allocation was used under the scheme in the pilot and transition phases. Auctioning is expected to be introduced in the scheme going forward.

 The use of offsets is permitted. A domestic program for the generation of offset credits that can be surrendered for compliance is being established. Domestic projects that have been validated and verified under internationally or domestically recognized protocols (still to be specified) will be eligible. Emission reductions related to all GHGs will be eligible, except for those related to direct CO2 emissions. 

Offsets generated by projects in Mexico that occurred before the pilot phase of the ETS may also be eligible under the scheme. These credits are referred to as early action credits.  

Participants can meet up to 10% of their compliance obligations with offset or early action credits.

Various cooperation activities have taken place in recent years. Mexico signed a Memorandum of Understanding with California in 2014 and with Québec in 2015 that includes cooperation on emissions trading. In August 2016, Mexico, Québec, and Ontario issued a joint declaration on carbon markets collaboration.

It is an intensity-based ETS for large industrial emitters, in which each covered entity must surrender compliance units for emissions that exceed each facility’s annual emissions limit. Each facility’s annual emissions limit is based on a combination of historical emission intensity, actual production activity data, and an annually decreasing reduction factor. Special provisions are in place for offshore petroleum facilities which must reduce emissions by an equivalent percentage in absolute terms (regardless of production). The system applies to the same sectors and GHGs as the federal Canadian system, and follows the same price trajectory, rising CAD 15 (USD 11.11) each year until 2030, resulting in a price of CAD 170 (USD 125) per tCO2e in 2030.  
";"In line with the federal OBPS pricing trajectory, the 2023 price rose to CAD 65 (USD 48.15) per tCO2e and will increase to CAD 80 (USD 59.26) per tCO2e in 2024. 
";"The mandatory inclusion threshold is set lower than in the Canadian federal system, applying to facilities in covered sectors with emissions exceeding 25,000 tCO2e/year and with a voluntary opt-in option for smaller emitters (emitting any amount greater than 15 tCO2e/year). 
 Operators can earn performance credits if their emission intensity is below the target level, and sell these credits to other covered operators or bank them for future compliance cycles. ";The scheme includes a price ceiling called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Covered entities can purchase and surrender credits from Newfoundland and Labrador’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to compensate for emissions exceeding performance limits. These (fund) credits cannot be banked, transferred, or refunded. The price ceiling is aligned with the federal minimum carbon price (CAD 65, USD 48.15, in 2023).

Allocation is determined in relation to annual emissions limits based on emissions intensity benchmarks. For onshore industrial facilities, baseline emissions intensity is determined with reference to units of output. For mobile offshore industrial facilities, baseline emissions intensity is determined with reference to hours of operation. Entities that emit less than their emissions limit receive credits, free of charge, corresponding to the number of tonnes of CO2e below the limit. This is similar to free allocation based on benchmarks. These credits can be banked or sold to entities that emit more than their emissions limits.   The total emission limit under the Newfoundland and Labrador PSS is the bottom-up combination of the absolute emission baseline for each covered facility.;Point source. Operators are liable for reporting the emissions covered under the Newfoundland and Labrador PSS at a facility level and meet their compliance obligations for the emissions above the emission intensity target (onshore facilities) or absolute emissions target (offshore facilities). For onshore facilities, this is equivalent to the actual production activity level multiplied by the difference between the actual and baseline emissions intensity.  The approach excludes purchased electricity and scope 3 emissions. Operators need to meet their compliance obligations on an annual basis.

However the OBPS standards will become more stringent over time. ;"The Nova Scotia OBPS sets facility-level emissions-intensity standards (performance standards) for electricity generators and large industrial emitters. 

The Nova Scotia OBPS is mandatory for facilities with annual emissions equal to or more than 50,000 tCO2e. Other facilities under this threshold with annual emissions of  ≥10,000 tCO2e/year have the option to voluntarily join the system. If not, they would be subject to the Canada federal fuel charge.

Emissions up until the benchmark do not require payment, with only the surplus triggering the compliance obligation. Entities that emit less than their emissions limit receive performance credits (compliance units) free of charge, corresponding to the number of tonnes of CO2e below the limit. This is similar to free allocation based on benchmarks. These performance credits can be banked as a way to meet future obligations, or they can be sold to other regulated entities that emit more than their emissions limits (see below for more details).   The total amount of emission allowances is determined top-down and decreases annually.";"Point source (industry, power). 
 The compliance cycle is based on a four-year compliance period. Operators have to submit their emissions reports on an annual basis. Operators need to meet their compliance obligations by December 15 in the year after the compliance period ends. The use of offset credits is allowed to fulfil a facility’s compliance obligation. Regulations still need to be finalized.

A federal carbon pricing backstop system comes into effect, in whole or in part in any province or territory that requests it or that does not have a price on carbon in place that meets the minimum standards.  The federal backstop system consists of two components: a regulatory charge on fuels and a baseline-and-credit ETS for emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industrial facilities called the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS). All direct proceeds from the federal system are returned to the province or territory of origin.
    
As of 1 April 2024, the federal fuel charge applies in Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, and Yukon. ";"In October 2023, the Canadian Government announced that it would be temporarily pausing the application of the fuel charge on deliveries of light fuel oil for use exclusively for providing heat to a building or similar structure, for a three-year period. 

In addition, to provide increased support for rural Canadians, the government announced in October 2023 its intention to double the rate of the supplement of the Canada Carbon Rebate (previously called the climate action incentive payments) to those living in small and rural communities from 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the baseline amount, starting in April 2024. 

In February 2024, the government announced the Canada Carbon Reabate amounts (previously called Climate Action Incentive Payments) for 2024-25.";"The charge covers all GHG emissions from 21 types of fuel delivered, transferred, used, produced, imported or brought into a province and territory where the federal fuel charge applies. It also applies on combustible waste that is burned for the purpose of producing heat or energy in those jurisdictions.  

It includes some targeted relief for certain uses in agriculture and fisheries and in electricity generation for remote communities, as well as a temporary pause on deliveries of light fuel oil for use exclusively for providing heat to a building or similar structure. It does not cover emissions from livestock or LULUCF.  Certain uses of fossil fuels transport are exempt from the federal fuel charge. In addition, fuels exported or removed from jurisdictions under the backstop system are also exempted from the fuel charge, but may face other carbon pricing depending on where they are ultimately transported to. There are also some exemptions from the fuel charge for farmers, fishers, remote off-grid communities, and temporary relief for light fuel oil used to provide heat to a building or similar structure. In general, large industrial facilities that are registered emitters under either the federal output-based pricing system (OBPS) or a similar provincial large emitter system do not pay the fuel charge but are subject to a separate pricing system for industrial facilities. 

Generally, the fuel charge applies early in the supply chain and is payable by a registered producer or distributor. The fuel charge started at CAD 20 (USD 14.81) per tCO₂e in 2019 and increased annually by CAD 10 (USD 7.40), until it reached CAD 50 (USD 37.03) per tCO₂e in 2022. The updated fuel charge started at CAD 65 (USD 48.15) from April 2023, and increases by CAD 15 (USD 11.11) each year until it reaches CAD 170 (USD 125.93) in 2030.";The price increases each year in line with a pre-defined schedule. The minimum carbon price is set out in the “Minimum National Carbon Pollution Price Schedule”.  ;Upstream. Generally, registered distributors and producers of the fossil fuels covered are liable for payment of the charge upon use or delivery of those fuels. End users generally do not have direct compliance obligations as their purchased fuel already has the fuel charge embedded.  In most cases, the federal fuel charge is paid on a monthly basis.  ;"The federal backstop system applies in jurisdictions that request it or do not have a system in place that meets minimum national stringency criteria, as set out in the minimum national stringency standards.  

In general, in jurisdictions where both components of the federal carbon pollution pricing system apply, large industries are relieved from the fuel charge but are subject to a separate pricing system for industrial facilities. A similar mechanism exists in jurisdictions where a provincial output-based system applies that meets the national stringency standards (e.g., in Alberta, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan). That is, large emitters in these provinces do not face the federal fuel charge but are subject to a separate pricing system for industrial facilities under their provincial large emitter system.

The tax is intended to support the effectiveness of the EU ETS in the Netherlands. The minimum carbon price for electricity and the minimum carbon price for industry act as a floor for the EU ETS price, and rise each year. The Carbon levy is charged where operators emit above a baseline. The policy applies to over 270230 companies. The minimum carbon price for electricity and the minimum carbon price for industry will increase gradually to EUR31.9/tCO2 in 2030. The levy rate increases by EUR10.56/tCO2e each year, up to EUR128.71/tCO2e in 2030. The tax act provides for at least two recalibrations of the tax rate, in 2022 and 2024, to ensure the desired emission reduction in 2030 is achieved.;"Given the EU ETS price remained well above the level of the floor prices, the price floors were not activated this past year (2023). Following a request of the Senate, the Dutch Emissions Authority recommended a new, higher price trajectory for the minimum carbon prices for electricity and industry. A legislative proposal for the update was accepted by the house of representatives in November 2023 but the proposal was rejected by the Senate in December 2023 after the general elections took place.  
";The ‘Minimum carbon price for electricity’ applies to direct CO2 emissions from all electricity generators (including co-generation in industrial facilities) that are covered by the EU ETS. The ‘Minimum carbon price for industry’ (as of 1 January 2023) applies to direct CO2 emissions from all industrial facilities also covered by the EU ETS plus waste incineration. The CO2 levy applies to direct CO2 and N2O emissions from industrial facilities covered by the EU ETS plus waste incineration.  Industrial installations pay the CO2 levy if their emissions exceed their baseline, which is based on EU ETS benchmarks and a national reduction factor needed to reach the emission target. For installations covered by the EU ETS, the EU ETS price is deducted from the levy payable. Emissions below this baseline are exempted and are allocated dispensation rights. Dispensation rights will be reduced annually until 2030 by annually decreasing the national reduction factor. The reduction factor for 2023 is determined at 1.213 and will annually decrease by 0.078.  from 1.21% in 2020 to 0.69% after 2030. Installations can exchange dispensation rights over the past calendar year. Covered installations can also use a surplus of dispensation rights to get a refund of tax paid in any of the past 5 years. A reduction factor is applied. Each benchmark value is effectively reduced by 3 % over the compliance period.;The prices are set by the Government The minimum carbon price for electricity and for industry only apply if the EU ETS price is lower than the set minimum.

It is an emission intensity-based baseline-and-credit ETS for large industrial emitters, in which covered entities are required to fulfill a compliance obligation for emissions that exceed the facility’s annual permitted emissions. Emissions limits are based on production levels multiplied by an emissions intensity value. Each facility’s baseline draws on historical emissions and production data. All emissions up until the limit do not require payment, with only the surplus triggering the compliance obligation. 

A compliance obligation may be fulfilled by retiring performance credits (compliance units) generated within the OBPS Program or by making a payment at a prescribed rate per tonne of CO2e into the Saskatchewan Technology Fund.

In its first phase spanning from 2023 to 2024, it exclusively targets coal-fired power plants connected to the Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) grid with a capacity of 25 MW or more. For 2023, the ETS covered 99 coal-fired power plants, estimated to represent around 81.4 % of the country’s power generation capacity.

Covered entities are required to surrender allowances corresponding to all their covered emissions, with allocation based on PTBAE (intensity targets), emission intensity, and emission average. Additionally, entities have the option to purchase allowances via auctions.  ";"The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) launched the Indonesian ETS for the power sector in February 2023.  
 
This launch was the culmination of several years of preparation. In October 2022, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) issued Regulation 21/2022 titled “Guidelines for Carbon Economic Value Implementation”. This regulation provided the legal basis for the implementation of a cross-sectoral ETS in Indonesia.
 

";"Initially, coal-fired power generation facilities with a production capacity exceeding 100 MW are included. However, smaller coal and fossil fuel plants may be incorporated at a later point.

The Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) has indicated that the government plans to implement emission caps for four additional sectors in the future: forestry, industrial processes and product use, agriculture, and waste management. 
 ";" To date, no auctions have taken place. Details regarding auction shares and related requirements or provisions are yet to be determined.

The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) sets intensity targets based on installations’ average emissions of the previous year. These targets dictate the number of allowances allocated for every MWh of electricity generated. If the necessary data are unavailable, allocations are based on comparisons with similar plants of equivalent installed capacity. It is anticipated that installations will receive either 75% or up to 85% of their allowances for free in 2024. The deduction percentage depends on the installations’ compliance with the ETS.

The national ETS complements the EU ETS by covering all fuel emissions not covered by the bloc’s system. It is being phased in gradually, with an increasing fixed price per tCO2 from 2021 to 2025. 

During the fixed price and price corridor phases, the cap is flexible. Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions, and allocation is based on auctions or free allocation. 
 
The national ETS was established through the 2019 “Fuel Emissions Trading Act” 2019, which was amended in 2020, 2022 and again in 2023. 
";"In 2023, the German government successfully concluded all legislative adjustments to the German national ETS. 
 
In November 2023, a EUR 60 billion (USD 65.2 billion) budgetary shortfall emerged due to a significant ruling by Germany’s Constitutional Court, resulting in a EUR 17 billion (USD 18.5 billion) financial gap for the year 2024. Subsequently, in December 2023, the German parliament approved a departure from the initially proposed EUR 5 (USD 5.40) increase for 2024, endorsing a EUR 15 (USD 16.3) hike in carbon prices (from EUR 30 (USD 32.6) in 2023 to EUR 45 (USD 49) in 2024) set to take effect in January 2024.  
 
Additionally, the inclusion of GHG emissions from the combustion of coal began as planned from January 2023. The inclusion of fuels used in waste incinerators in the ETS began in January 2024.   ";"All main fuel types (gasoline, diesel, heating oil, natural and liquid gases) have been covered from the outset, while other fuels such as coal and the incineration of waste will gradually be phased in by the end of 2024.

 Emissions from biogenic fuels that meet the sustainability criteria as set out in national regulations transposing the “European Renewable Energy Directives 2029/28/EC” and “2018/2001” do not face compliance obligations. 

The system started with a limited scope in 2021 and 2022, including fuel oil, LPG, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel. Coal was added in 2023. Fuels used in waste incineration are covered from 2024 onwards.  The German ETS is accompanied by a compensation mechanism to avoid carbon leakage for emissions-intensive trade-exposed sectors. Industries eligible for compensation are those on the carbon leakage list of the EU ETS Phase 4. In contrast to the EU ETS, the German ETS does not use free allocation, but compensation based on sectoral fuel benchmarks and fixed compensation levels.";"Additional allowances exceeding the cap can be acquired by entities in the fixed-price phase.  
 
In 2026, auctions of allowances will contain a price corridor of a minimum price of EUR55/tCO2e and a maximum price of EUR65/tCO2e. 
In 2026, auctions of allowances will contain a price corridor of a minimum price of EUR55/tCO2e and a maximum price of EUR65/tCO2e.  Fixed price phase (2021 to 2025): Allowances are sold for a fixed price. The price increase for 2023 was suspended and further increases have been postponed by one year as a response to the energy crisis. The new price schedule is as follows:  
- 2021: EUR 25 (USD 27.17) 
- 2022: EUR 30 (USD 32.60) 
- 2023: EUR 30 (USD 32.60) 
- 2024: EUR 45 (USD 48.90)
- 2025: EUR 55 (USD 59.78)  The cap has not been set yet. Cap will be set in a regulation in 2020 and will be based on Germany’s legally binding reduction targets for the non-EU ETS sectors. However, in the initial phase of the national ETS the cap will not be absolute.";Upstream. Applies to fuel suppliers. Operators need to meet their compliance obligations on an annual basis.   ;"The German national ETS is not linked with any other system. Emissions from facilities covered by the EU ETS are exempt.

This regulation establishes a national ETS covering emissions from the industrial and power sectors. It includes provisions for banking allowances, a minimum reserve price of EUR 24 (USD 26.08), and a linear reduction factor for the emissions cap of 1.5% annually in the period from 2020 to 2030.  
  
The ETS formally began operations in February 2020 and applies to three installations: the Pljevlja coal plant, the KAP aluminium plant, and the Tosčelik steel mill. Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions, and allocation is based on auctions or free allocation. They received 100% of their allowances for free in 2020 and 2021. For 2022, 64% of all allowances were auctioned. ";"The operation of the Montenegro ETS was negatively affected by several changes of government in the past two years, which caused major delays in the adoption of the yearly allocation plan. In addition, two of the three covered installations shut down their operations in 2022 in response to rapidly rising energy prices. This is still the case as of January 2024, leaving the Pljevlja coal plant as the only operational covered entity.  
 
The Montenegro government set up a working group in mid-2022 to review the country’s climate legislation, including the ETS. This work was still ongoing as of January 2024, with the adoption of the revised Climate Law expected by mid-2024. Following this first step, the ETS Decree is due to be renewed. This will likely involve a revision of the ETS cap as well as the introduction of auctioning for 100% of allowances.  ";Industries listed under Appendix 1 of the “ETS Decree must participate in the system. These include power plants, oil refineries, coke production, the production or processing of iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, cement clinker, glass, ceramic products, and paper (pulp).

";Point source;Not permitted;"The UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) began operating in January 2021, following the departure of the UK (excluding power operators located in Northern Ireland) from the EU ETS. Verified emissions from stationary UK ETS operators currently cover around a quarter of the UK’s territorial GHG emissions. The first phase of the UK ETS runs until 2030. 
 
The UK ETS covers around 1,000 installations in the power and industrial sectors, as well as around 400 aircraft operators. Aviation activity covered includes flights within the UK as well as flights departing the UK to the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. Covered installations and aircraft operators must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Allowances are allocated primarily through auctioning, with a portion freely allocated to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage. The system has both a cost containment mechanism (CCM) and auction reserve price, to support market stability.  
 
The UK government remains open to the possibility of linking the UK ETS to other systems, if such a link would be advantageous for both systems. ";"In July 2023, the UK ETS Authority announced a package of reforms aimed at aligning the scheme with each of the government’s climate targets, such as the 2050 net-zero target. The announcement marked the conclusion of the previous year’s public consultation on developing the scheme, which ran between March and June 2022. 
 
Among the changes was a 30% reduction in the total number of allowances available over the period 2021 to 2030, to bring the cap trajectory in line with the country’s net-zero strategy. 
 
The UK ETS Authority has also announced its intention to cover emissions from domestic maritime activities from 2026, and from waste incineration and waste from energy from 2028 (preceded by a two-year MRV-only period from 2026 to 2028). 
 
Further consultation on bringing additional sectors into the UK ETS and incorporation of GGRs is anticipated. 
  
The UK government has announced it will introduce aCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism by 2027.";"The UK ETS covers emissions of CO2, N2O, and PFCs in energy-intensive industries, the power sector, and aviation within the UK and European Economic Area. A share of allowances is distributed freely to Emissions Intensive Trade Exposed (EITE) sectors.

Hospitals and small emitters with emissions lower than 25 kt CO2e annually can opt out of the ETS.";"The UK ETS Authority launched a consultation in December 2023 on the potential introduction and design of a Supply Adjustment mechanism.   
 
The UK ETS has a Cost Containment Reserve to avoid price spikes by auctioning additional allowances. If the CCM is triggered, regulators can decide on whether and how to intervene. The intervention can include: redistributing allowances between the current year’s auctions; bringing forward UKA supply from future years; drawing from the Market Stability Mechanism Account; auctioning up to 25% of remaining allowances in the NER; or auctioning allowances left unallocated from the industry cap in a given year. 
 
The Cost Containment Reserve is triggered if, for six consecutive months, the allowance price is three times the average allowance price in effect in the UK in the two preceding years.  
 
To ensure a minimum level of ambition in the transition from the EU ETS to the UK ETS, an Auction Reserve Price of GBP 22 (USD27.50) is in place. Auctioning is the primary means of allowance allocation in the UK ETS. Auctions have a GBP 22 (USD 27.50) Auction Reserve Price (ARP), below which allowances will not be sold. In December 2023, the UK ETS Authority launched a consultation on the level and design of the current ARP. Auctions clear even when not all allowances are sold. Unsold allowances are carried over to the next four auctions, up to a limit of 125% of allowances originally intended for sale at those auctions. If all four subsequent auctions reach the 125% limit, the remaining unsold allowances are transferred into the Market Stability Mechanism Account.

A number of UKAs are allocated for free to industrial participants at risk of carbon leakage. The number of free allowances that an installation is entitled to is determined using the historical activity level, an industry benchmark, and a carbon leakage exposure factor (CLEF). The benchmarks and CLEFs that have been used initially are those used in Phase 4 of the EU ETS. Historical activity levels are based on data collected under the EU ETS.  
 
There is a maximum number of allowances allocated for free (the “industry cap”). From 2024, the industry cap is now set at 40% of the total cap and reduces annually in line with the cap trajectory.  ";Point source, at the point of combustion. One calendar year. Covered entities have until the end of April of the following year to surrender allowances. These provisions are the same as under the EU ETS. The use of offsets for compliance is not permitted at this time, although the UK government has indicated it is open to reviewing this as the scheme evolves, especially in deciding on how to implement obligations under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) alongside the ETS for aviation.   ;"The UK ETS is not linked with any other system. 
The UK government has indicated it is open to the possibility of internationally linking the scheme in the future but has not made any decision on preferred linking partners. The post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and UK stipulates that the jurisdictions “shall give serious consideration to linking their respective carbon pricing systems in a way that preserves the integrity of these systems and provides for the possibility to increase their effectiveness”.

Although the NEHG does not establish a carbon tax, the carbon pricing instrument follows in central parts the logic of existing energy taxes (fuel tax, coal tax, and natural gas tax). Thus, if a certain event is taxable under the existing energy taxes regime, an obligation to buy allowances arises under the NEHG. Taxable events are the production, import, or release of energy products from a tax warehouse in Austria or the supply of coal and natural gas to consumers. In practice, only a limited number of energy distributors and oil companies are subject to the NEHG 2022.
 
The NEHG aims to cover emissions outside the EU ETS, encompassing predominantly emissions in the buildings and transport sectors. Between 2022 and 2025, the system will operate with an annually increasing fixed price and a flexible cap, such that more allowances will be available for entities if needed. The NEHG is being phased in gradually. The system has been designed in line with the reduction targets for non-EU ETS sectors as defined by the “European Effort Sharing Regulation” (ESR). The system may eventually transfer into the EU ETS 2. ";In 2023, the NEHG successfully completed its inaugural year. Covered entities began surrendering national emission allowances on a quarterly basis, beginning in March.  ;"The Austria ETS applies to fossil fuels used in the transport, buildings, agriculture, and energy sectors, as well as from small industries. This essentially concerns the following fossil energy sources: petrol, gasoil (diesel), heating oil, natural gas, liquefied gas, coal, and kerosene. Fuels in admixture with biogenic fuels receive a lower emissions factor than purely fossil fuels. ENtities that would be liable for less than 1 tonne of CO2e per year are excluded. In practice it covers mostly buildings and road transport. Provisions are in place to avoid unnecessary double burdens for installations covered by the EU ETS. Emissions that arise from a fuel delivered to and used in an EU ETS installation must be reported by said installation and can then be exempted from the NEHG 2022. The exemption can be granted in advance, although a subsequent refund is also possible. 
 
Companies that are particularly affected by the NEHG 2022 (e.g., in the transport sector) can apply for a partial refund of the carbon price to avoid “hardship” cases. ";"Until 2025 allowances will be sold at a price set by the Government. The price increases each year in line with a pre-determined schedule. Companies must surrender national emission allowances based on their emissions every quarter of the year; the first surrender day is the end of March 2023.

The draft bill intended to replace part of the existing fuel excise charges applied to gasoline through the Specific Internal Tax (IMESI), with a tax based on the carbon emissions. 
The bill became Law No. 19,996 (November 3, 2021), with article 326 containing provisions on the carbon tax.

Taiwan, China, enacted the “GHG Reduction and Management Act” (the Act) in 2015, which legislates a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. It also mandates regulatory mitigation goals to be set in stages. The Act further stipulates that the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA) will implement a domestic cap-and-trade scheme. This is further referred to in the “Climate Change Action Guideline 2017”.  
 
The Act also mandated TEPA to develop a “GHG Reduction Action Plan”, which was published in 2018. This plan outlines strategies for mitigation policies; it includes five-year regulatory goals for national and sectoral GHG emissions and eight policy implementation packages. The plan also proposes to implement a cap-and-trade system, calculate baseline emissions, and establish regulations – although there is no precise timeline. 

Subsidiary regulations are also in place. Mandatory emissions reporting for entities with annual emissions above 25,000 tCO2e from certain sectors has been in place since 2014. The “2018 Regulations Governing GHG Offset Program Management” allows enterprises to acquire carbon offset credits.  ";"The “Climate Change Response Act” passed the third reading in the Legislative Yuan in January 2023 and went into force in February 2023. 
 
In August, Taiwan upgraded the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration to a Ministry (TEPA)--the Ministry of Environment (MOE), which in turn established a new Climate Change Administration (CCA) to lead – in consultation with other relevant central competent authorities – on climate policy design and implementation, including the carbon fee and ETS. The MOE also announced that 512 companies that emit more than 25,000 tCO2e a year will be subject to the carbon fee from 2025, based on verification of their total emissions for 2024.  

The carbon fee rates will be determined by the Rate Review Committee based on factors such as the current state of GHG reduction in Taiwan, types of emission sources, categories of GHG emissions, emission scale, voluntary reduction efforts and reduction effectiveness. International carbon pricing implementation and Taiwan's industrial competitiveness will also be considered. 

In August 2023, the Taiwan Carbon Solution Exchange (TCX) was set up with a focus first on consultation and capacity building. High quality international offsets are expected to be available by early 2024 for voluntary purposes, and trading of domestic offsets to meet mandatory requirements will start after regulations are set by the CCA. 
 
In October 2023, the  CCA announced two new regulations. The first sets out that entities emitting less than 25,000 tCO2e (and therefore not subject to the carbon fee) will be eligible to develop voluntary carbon emission reduction projects that follow internationally accepted MRV guidance. The second establishes that entities setting up new facilities emitting more than 25,000 tCO2e a year, plus development or high-rise construction projects, will be required to offset 10% of the annual increase in GHGs for ten consecutive years. These entities can either buy carbon credits from voluntary projects or implement other carbon reduction activities, e.g., replacing fuel-run motorcycles or agricultural machines with electric ones or using high-efficiency air conditioning. 
 
In December 2023, the CCA published two draft regulations on the establishment of the carbon fee review committee and establishing the carbon fee. The draft regulations are currently undergoing public consultation. The cap for the use of international offset is set at 5%, using Singapore’s carbon tax as a reference. ";;  0;  The Climate Change Response Act stipulates that domestic early action and offset credits will be allowed to meet the carbon fee and ETS obligations. The MOE, in consultation with relevant central competent authorities, will also recognize international offset credits with the standards and cap to be decided later. ;;Industry, Mining and extractives, Transport, Aviation, Buildings, Agriculture, forestry and fishing fuel use, Agricultural emissions, Waste, LULUCF;2024;;East Asia & Pacific;Upper middle income;Subnacional - Estado/Província;24,93836745;118,58541419241348

ETS_CL;Chile ETS;Sistema  de comércio de licenças de emissão (ETS);Em consideração;Chile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In June 2022, Chile enacted its “Framework Law on Climate Change”, which sets a 2050 carbon neutrality goal and describes the national, regional, and local climate policies that Chile will implement to achieve it. These include Chile’s NDC, Long-Term Climate Strategy, Climate Change Financial Strategy, and sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans. 

Article 14 of the law mandates the Ministry of Environment to specify GHG emissions limits set by technology, sector, or activity. GHG emissions limits may be set as emissions benchmarks for individual installations or in aggregate, for a group of installations or a sector. If set in aggregate, GHG emissions limits could be akin to a cap. According to Article 15, installations that perform better than their benchmark will have their surplus emissions reductions certified, which may then be used by other regulated entities for compliance with their respective emissions limits. 

The specific design of the emissions limits system is not yet defined and could be implemented either as an ETS or a tradable performance standard. In November 2023, the Ministry of Environment published the “Draft Rules for the Development of GHG Emissions and Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Limits” for public consultation. The document specifies procedures and characteristics of the emission limits to be developed under the Framework Law.

Based on Article 37 of the Law, which provides a basis for the development of market-based, fiscal, and financial instruments to address the negative impacts of GHG emissions, the country’s “2022-2026 Energy Agenda” states that a pilot ETS project for the energy sector will be developed. Work around this will be supported by the World Bank’s Partnership for Market Implementation.

Chile has had a carbon tax in place since 2017. The country’s “Long-Term Climate Strategy”, presented in October 2021, specifies that Chile will set an increasing trajectory for its carbon price between 2025 and 2030. It also specifies that the country seeks to have an integral carbon pricing portfolio to deliver coherent and predictable price signals. In line with this, the government launched its “National Energy Policy by 2050”, which states that carbon prices in Chile should reach USD 35/tCO2e by 2030 and USD 80/tCO2e by 2040.";Between December 2023 and February 2024, the “2023-2030 Green Hydrogen Action Plan” was subject to public consultation. Among others, it also proposes an ETS for the energy sector, with the aim of promoting the implementation of projects for the consumption of green hydrogen and derivatives in the economy.;;;"  Article 14 of the Framework Law on Climate Change stipulates that emissions reduction or removal certificates from projects implemented within Chile may be used for compliance with the emissions standards defined in Articles 14 and 15 of the law. The Draft Rules for the Development of GHG Emissions and Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Limits specify that a limit of 5% for the use of emissions reduction or removal certificates in lieu of the compliance obligation of entities regulated under Article 14 of the Framework Law. 

 

The government has also developed a National Mitigation Actions Registry (Registro Nacional de Acciones de Mitigación – RENAMI). This will allow the implementation of the offset scheme approved in the carbon tax reform and would constitute a key element for other instruments, such as the scheme proposed in the Framework Law on Climate Change or emerging instruments under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.  

 

As per the “Agreement N°17/2022 - Regulation of Projects for The Reduction of Pollutant Emissions to Offset Taxable Emissions Pursuant to Article 8 of Law No. 20.780”, entities under the carbon tax scheme can use offset credits to meet their compliance obligations.

Covered entities will have to surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (Minambiente) will determine the number of allowances in line with Colombia’s national mitigation targets. Minambiente is also in charge of allocation, which will take place primarily via auctions. Non-compliance is to be punishable by a fine of up to double the auction price. Auction revenues, as updated by Article 262 of Law 2294 of 2023, will now be allocated to the “Fund for Life and Biodiversity” (formerly the “Fund for Sustainability and Climate Resilience”). These funds are designated for purposes set by the national carbon tax, as well as for administering the PNCTE and the Mandatory Emissions Report under Law 2169 of 2021. The Climate Change law also includes crediting provisions: voluntary actions of non-regulated entities that generate GHG emissions reductions or removals may be issued allowances if they are verified, certified, and registered in the National Emission Reductions Registry (Registro nacional de reducción de emisiones de GEI – Renare), and deemed eligible for the program.
The PNCTE will complement Colombia's revised carbon tax, according to Resolution 12 of 2023 by the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs. The 2018 “Climate Change Management Law” states that the government may recognize tonnes paid through the carbon tax as part of the compliance obligation of regulated entities under the PNCTE. 
The ETS design is currently being analyzed by the government. The 2021 “Climate Action Law” (Ley de Acción Climática) sets a goal to fully implement the ETS by 2030. This has also set an obligation for legal persons to report direct and indirect GHG emissions, following criteria to be set by Minambiente. It also appoints an independent group of experts (the Study Commission) to provide recommendations and promote and develop carbon markets in Colombia.

The federal government's proposal for the establishment of the Brazilian Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading System (Sistema Brasileiro de Comércio de Emissões de Gases de Efeito Estufa, SBCE) was guided by the recommendations of the PMR Brazil project, which indicated the adoption of a cap-and-trade scheme as the most desirable carbon pricing option within the PNMC. 
 
Under draft bill (Projeto de Lei, PL) “PL 412/2022” the government proposal was approved with minor modifications by the Senate in October 2023. Under draft bill “2148/2015”, the Chamber of Deputies modified and approved the establishment of the SBCE in late December 2023. The reviewed proposal will be sent back to the Senate for new appreciation under PL 2148/2015, and the National Congress is expected to approve it in 2024. 
 
PL 2148/2015 would establish the governance framework and the legal foundation for obligations by covered entities, with key design elements (such as scope, cap, and allocation) to be determined in the coming years.
";;;;"  Covered entities would be allowed to surrender domestic offset credits to meet part of their compliance obligation. Projects would have to be verified through an “independent conformity assessment”. Once registered in the SBCE registry as Verified Emissions Reduction or Removal Certificates (CRVE), the offset credits will become eligible for use under the SBCE. The agriculture, land-use change and forestry sectors – responsible for more than 60% of emissions in Brazil – are expected to play a key role in the generation of CRVE. Provisions for REDD+ credits are already included in the draft bill.  

The draft bill also explicitly defines the rights of indigenous peoples and traditional communities with regard to carbon crediting. This includes the right to commercialize offset credits generated on lands they traditionally occupy, as well as the compensation for any damages resulting from offset credit projects. Actors involved in offset credit projects would also have to adhere to a benefit-sharing regulation.  
 
The draft bill also stipulates that both SBCE allowances and CRVE would be eligible for international transfers under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, subject to authorization by a designated national entity. The Superior and Deliberative Board would establish conditions for such authorizations. The SBCE registry will track both national and international transactions.

Taiwan, China, enacted the “GHG Reduction and Management Act” (the Act) in 2015, which legislates a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. It also mandates regulatory mitigation goals to be set in stages. The Act further stipulates that the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA) will implement a domestic cap-and-trade scheme. This is further referred to in the “Climate Change Action Guideline 2017”.  
 
The Act also mandated TEPA to develop a “GHG Reduction Action Plan”, which was published in 2018. This plan outlines strategies for mitigation policies; it includes five-year regulatory goals for national and sectoral GHG emissions and eight policy implementation packages. The plan also proposes to implement a cap-and-trade system, calculate baseline emissions, and establish regulations – although there is no precise timeline. 

Subsidiary regulations are also in place. Mandatory emissions reporting for entities with annual emissions above 25,000 tCO2e from certain sectors has been in place since 2014. The “2018 Regulations Governing GHG Offset Program Management” allows enterprises to acquire carbon offset credits.  ";"The “Climate Change Response Act” passed the third reading in the Legislative Yuan in January 2023 and went into force in February 2023. 
 
In August, Taiwan upgraded the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration to a Ministry (TEPA)--the Ministry of Environment (MOE), which in turn established a new Climate Change Administration (CCA) to lead – in consultation with other relevant central competent authorities – on climate policy design and implementation, including the carbon fee and ETS. The MOE also announced that 512 companies that emit more than 25,000 tCO2e a year will be subject to the carbon fee from 2025, based on verification of their total emissions for 2024.  

The carbon fee rates will be determined by the Rate Review Committee based on factors such as the current state of GHG reduction in Taiwan, types of emission sources, categories of GHG emissions, emission scale, voluntary reduction efforts and reduction effectiveness. International carbon pricing implementation and Taiwan's industrial competitiveness will also be considered. 

In August 2023, the Taiwan Carbon Solution Exchange (TCX) was set up with a focus first on consultation and capacity building. High quality international offsets are expected to be available by early 2024 for voluntary purposes, and trading of domestic offsets to meet mandatory requirements will start after regulations are set by the CCA. 
 
In October 2023, the  CCA announced two new regulations. The first sets out that entities emitting less than 25,000 tCO2e (and therefore not subject to the carbon fee) will be eligible to develop voluntary carbon emission reduction projects that follow internationally accepted MRV guidance. The second establishes that entities setting up new facilities emitting more than 25,000 tCO2e a year, plus development or high-rise construction projects, will be required to offset 10% of the annual increase in GHGs for ten consecutive years. These entities can either buy carbon credits from voluntary projects or implement other carbon reduction activities, e.g., replacing fuel-run motorcycles or agricultural machines with electric ones or using high-efficiency air conditioning. 
 
In December 2023, the CCA published two draft regulations on the establishment of the carbon fee review committee and establishing the carbon fee. The draft regulations are currently undergoing public consultation. The cap for the use of international offset is set at 5%, using Singapore’s carbon tax as a reference. ";;;  The Climate Change Response Act stipulates that domestic early action and offset credits will be allowed to meet the carbon fee and ETS obligations. The MOE, in consultation with relevant central competent authorities, will also recognize international offset credits with the standards and cap to be decided later. ;;;2016;;East Asia & Pacific;Upper middle income;Subnacional - Estado/Província;24,93836745;118,58541419241348

The framework legislation also empowers MONRE to set the ETS cap and determine the method of allowance allocation. It also allows for the inclusion of domestic and international offset credits in the ETS. 
 
“Decree 06/2022/ND-CP” outlines a roadmap for the implementation of the NCM and the ETS. The decree requires facilities with annual GHG emissions above 3,000 tCO2e to submit a biennial inventory report of their emissions from 2025 onwards. The accompanying “Decision 01/2022/QD-TTg” lists the sectors and facilities with emissions inventory obligations.  
 
Decree 06 also includes provisions for developing a national ETS, focusing initially on the steel, cement, and thermal power sectors, with a declining cap that corresponds to Vietnam’s NDC. The roadmap for the ETS states that regulations and a trading platform should be in place by 2025. A pilot ETS is planned for 2027-. The ETS should be implemented from 2030, and provisions will allow for participation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

In April 2022, the final regulation to establish an ETS in Pennsylvania and to participate in RGGI was published. It set a base cap of 78 million short tons (70.8 MtCO2) if Pennsylvania was a participating state of RGGI as of 1 January 2022. The cap decreases by 3% annually to 58.1 million short tons (52.7 MtCO2) in 2030.

The regulation includes the implementation of both emissions containment and cost containment reserves, as well as quarterly auctions to allocate allowances. It includes additional features such as set-aside accounts (accounts from which allowances may be transferred to the accounts of regulated units or retired on their behalf) for waste coal and cogeneration units (including combined heat and power systems), and a limited exemption for cogeneration units that supply less than 15% of their total energy to the electricity grid. 
";"In April 2023, Governor Josh Shapiro convened a working group to assess Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI in the context of a three-part “test” (protection and creation of energy jobs, addressing climate change, and ensuring that the state had reliable, affordable, and clean power). The working group found consensus that cap-and-invest would be the optimal approach for Pennsylvania, but failed to reach consensus on a specific form the program would take. 
 
In November 2023, the Commonwealth Court ruled that money raised through the regulation constitutes a tax imposed by the DEP and EQB, and thus is in violation of the state’s constitution. According to the ruling, participation in RGGI is only possible through legislation passed by the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Shortly after the Commonwealth Court’s ruling, the Shapiro administration appealed the decision to the state’s Supreme Court. These matters are ongoing.

The program is anchored in the “Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act” of 2019, which requires a 40% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and at least an 85% reduction from 1990 levels by 2050. The NYCI program would cover all emitting sectors under a statewide cap. The cap would decrease over time, with the caps for 2030 and 2050 corresponding to statewide GHG emission limits. 
 
Various NYS agencies are developing the program rules, including the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). ";"In 2023, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) conducted stakeholder information sessions and third parties hosted an extensive set of learning sessions on the development of the economywide Cap-and-Invest Program.  
 
In August and September, NYSERDA and DEC hosted stakeholder feedback roundtables on matters of equity and climate justice and on just transition and labor, to ensure that New York’s Cap-and-Invest Program is an equitable program that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and creates green jobs.   
 
During January 2024, DEC and NYSERDA conducted workshops and webinars to engage the public and stakeholders in the development process, learning from successful emissions reduction programs implemented in other regions.

ETS_IN;India ETS;Sistema  de comércio de licenças de emissão (ETS);Em desenvolvimento;India;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The government of India introduced an amendment to the “Energy Conservation Act, 2001”, providing a legal basis for the establishment of a Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) and issuance of carbon credit certificates. The amendment bill, incorporating these provisions, was passed in the Lower House (Lok Sabha) in August 2022, adopted, and subsequently passed in the Upper House (Rajya Sabha) in December 2022. The amendment bill provides the legal basis to establish a domestic carbon market (ICM) and grants the power to issue carbon credit certificates (CCCs) for the reduction of emissions.  
 
Following passage of the amendment, the government began work on the institutional and regulatory framework for the CCTS. The draft notification was published for stakeholder consultation in March 2023. Based on received comments, the notification was revised and officially issued in June 2023. 

Under the compliance mechanism, obligated entities will receive an annual emissions intensity target covering a three-year period, denominated in tCO2e per unit of product. New emissions intensity targets will be announced every three years to enable longer-term planning for covered entities. If an obligated entity overachieves its emissions intensity target, it can earn CCCs based on the difference between the achieved and the targeted emissions intensity. Entities that fail to achieve their targets will have to surrender/purchase a corresponding number of CCCs to ensure compliance and this will be achieved by facilitating trading among the obligated entities on a registry/trading platform. In this way the scheme will operate as a baseline-and-credit emissions trading scheme. 
 
The CCTS scope will include both direct emissions from fuel combustion and industrial processes, as well as indirect emissions from electricity and heat consumption. It will cover CO2, and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).  
 
The CCTS will be based on the existing Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme – a mandatory energy efficiency scheme covering more than 1,000 entities from 13 energy-intensive sectors – that should be gradually transitioned into a compliance carbon market.

It is expected that a phased transition from the current PAT scheme to the compliance mechanism under CCTS will begin in 2024. The compliance mechanism will be jointly managed by the Ministry of Power, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, and the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). 
 
In December 2023, the government amended the CCTS notification, introducing provisions for the offset mechanism to support non-obligated entities and promote mitigation efforts, encompassing  a comprehensive approach for GHG reduction. The government is actively working to operationalize both the compliance and offset mechanisms. ";"In July 2022, the Indian Lower House of Parliament (Lok Sabha) adopted an amendment bill to the 2001 “Energy Conservation Act” to provide the legal basis to establish a domestic carbon market, and authorises the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) – a state agency under the Ministry of Power – to finalize the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme. In December 2022, the Upper House of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) passed the amendment bill. In October BEE released a draft paper for stakeholder consultation. That paper proposed the existing “Perform, Achieve and Trade” (PAT) scheme – a mandatory energy efficiency scheme covering more than 1,000 entities from 13 sectors – would be gradually transitioned into a compliance carbon market; the carbon market would utilize existing MRV guidelines and administrative infrastructure; and the compliance carbon market would be intensity-based. ";;;  ;;;2024;;Middle East & North Africa;Lower middle income;Nacional;22,3511148;78,6677428
Tax_NZ;New Zealand Carbon tax;Taxas de Carbono;Em consideração;New Zealand;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) was launched in 2008 and is a central climate change mitigation policy for the country. It covers roughly half of New Zealand’s GHG emissions.  
 
The cap is set in a top-down process to align with New Zealand’s 2050 net zero targets and associated emissions budgets. Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their reported emissions.  
 
The NZ ETS has broad sectoral coverage, including forestry, stationary energy, industrial processing, liquid fossil fuels, waste, and synthetic GHGs. 

 Uniquely to the NZ ETS, the forestry sector has both surrender obligations and the opportunity to earn units for emissions removals.  
 
Currently, biological emissions from agriculture have reporting obligations without surrender obligations. Under the current legislation, emissions from agriculture will face a carbon price by 2026, either through the NZ ETS or a separate pricing mechanism. However, the new government has committed to repealing this legislation to prevent agriculture becoming part of the NZ ETS, and alternatively developing a separate system solely for the sector.  
 
Extensive legislative reforms of the NZ ETS were implemented in 2020 to improve its design and operation and enable it to better support New Zealand’s international and domestic emissions reduction obligations. 
";"he supply of units to the NZ ETS was tightened in 2023, bringing the cap trajectory in line with New Zealand’s net-zero targets. Unit supply settings, as well as auction reserve price settings for 2024 to 2028, were updated in September in 2023 in accordance with a court order made following a successful legal challenge against the original settings. The new settings tighten unit supply, while also doubling the 2024 auction reserve price floor to NZD 64 (USD 39) and the CCR trigger price to at least NZD 184 (USD 112).  
 
Four auctions were undertaken throughout the year, with a total of 15 million units for sale, as well as another 8 million units available from the CCR. However, none of the auctions cleared, meaning no allowances were sold at auction in 2023.
 
A system of farm-level emissions reporting was being developed in preparation for pricing biological GHG emissions from agriculture. In August, the former government announced plans to implement a levy from 2025. However, the new government has stated it will progress pricing agricultural emissions by no later than 2030, and will also repeal the provisions in the Act which would bring the sector into the NZ ETS from 2026 to allow time to develop this new system.

The Baja California carbon tax entered into force in May 1, 2020 applying to the sale of gasoline, diesel, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. Baja California’s five municipalities were set to receive 20 percent of revenues from the carbon tax, for the promotion and development of environmental programs. This was to be proportionally distributed according to the revenue collected by each municipality. The state government was set to manage the remaining 80 percent, preferably to allocate it to the promotion and development of environmental programs. 
 
In 2021, the carbon tax was challenged and declared unconstitutional. Following this ruling, the government attempted to challenge the court's decision but was unsuccessful. As a result, the ruling on the unconstitutionality of the tax is now final and conclusive, and enforcement of the tax ceased across all entities.  
 
Unconstitutionality arguments centered on two main points: first, that the responsible authority did not have the competence to legislate on such matter of gasoline, reserved exclusively to the Federation; and second, that there was a case of double regulation, as the tax imposed by Baja California had the same point of regulation as the national carbon tax.
